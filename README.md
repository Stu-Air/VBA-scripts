ExcelVBA
This is a library of vba modules that I use in my Excel projects as well as modules I've submitted to various Excel documents.

Note the ".vb" is placed at the end of each filename to allow git to recognize the script type. You don't need these in your project. Typically, I'll copy the raw output to my module in Excel VBA so the name on Git is irrelevant. Enjoy!
